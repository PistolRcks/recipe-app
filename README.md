# recipe-app
*A school project used to learn Agile practices in CS358*

## What is This?
This is a school project for our CS358 class. It is meant to be a webapp which communicates with a database (only accessible on-campus) to allow for the creation of ingredients, recipes (which are made of ingredients), meals (which are made of recipes), and grocery lists (which are made of meals).

## Who is This For?
This project was only meant to be an example use-case of Agile practices, and isn't really meant to be actually used.

## What Not to Expect
* A completed product (we were not expected to complete it)
* A consistent product (we did not make a design document or set any coding practices)
* A good looking product (none of us know good CSS)
